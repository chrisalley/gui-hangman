The object of Hangman is to guess the mystery word (represented by asterisks) in the shortest amount of turns as possible. You can guess a letter by either clicking on the letter's button or by typing it with the keyboard. Each time you guess a letter wrong, your "hangman" will be hung a little more.<br />
