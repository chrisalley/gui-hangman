<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr />
<br />
GUI Hangman is a computer game designed to run on the Microsoft Windows platform. It is based on the traditionally two-player pen and pencil game of Hangman where one player is required to guess the word that the other player is think of in a certain number of turns. However, unlike off screen versions of the game, GUI Hangman puts the player up against a computer controlled opponent, as well as the high scores of other players.<br />
